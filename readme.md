# Phaser 3 Project

## Requirements

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

## Install and run

`npm install webpack webpack-cli -g`

`npm update`

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |

---

## Getting Started

After running `npm start` visit: ```http://localhost:8000``` in your browser. Your project is running here!

### src directory

Add your project files to the src directory. Only files in this directory will be included in the project build!

Updating and saving files in this folder will automatically rebuild the project and reload the project in the browser!

### assets directory

You must keep all of the file assets in the assets folder. This inlcudes images, audio and other data your project may load.
